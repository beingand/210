Here's the solution CSS: 

main {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
}

.animals main{
  background-color: lightskyblue;
}

.minerals main{
  background-color: pink;
}

.vegetables main {
  background-color: lightyellow;
}

@media (min-width: 750px){
  main {
    flex-direction: row;
  }
}

---------------

The key is identifying main as the flexbox, also known as the  flexbox container. The children of a flexbox are, by default, flex items. So the sections are the flex items.

Flex items can have direction.  Their flex direction is set on main, the flexbox container, as follows: 

At mobile size:

main { flex-direction: column }

At min-width:750px

main { flex-direction: row }
